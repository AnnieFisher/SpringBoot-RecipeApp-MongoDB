# SpringBoot-RecipeApp-MongoDB

This is my SpringBoot Recipe App refactored. I converted from using a relational database setup to using Mongo's noSql embedded database.
I also used a Gradle build instead of Maven. I then refactored the entire project to use reactive programming. I used Spring Data's ReactiveMongoRepository along with using the Flux and Mono classes in my service layer.
